# DND-3D-Play-Area
This project uses OpenSCAD to create play-mats for Dungeons and Dragons that can be 3D printed and configured for a 
unique play experience.

## Using this repository
Simply downloading this repository and 3D printing the files would not be using them to their full potential. Using 
OpenSCAD, you can easily configure these files to customize them for your campaign.
